# bitview-Downloader
UI-based downloader for Bitview.

This is based on AltTube-dl https://github.com/DareDeveloperbruh/AltTube-dl

# How to run it.

use this code when you've downloaded it: "python main.py"

# Why didn't I use autopytoexe

I planned to make an exe of the Python file with autopytoexe, but it must include video_downloader.py

# VENV

python -m venv .venv
